1.If you wanted to reuse this program for a file that had 17 headers lines. What line of code would you change in our program?
Write the line of code that you will replace here: if LineNumber > 0: 
What will be the new code?
Write the new code here:if LineNumber > 16: 
 
2. would happen if we don’t included import sys in our program?
Write you answer here: It will produce an error message. The program is not going to read the variables indicated in 
the script. In python, variables are indicated by “sys.argv” which is similar 
to “$” in bash.

3.Let’s suppose that the third file that the user provides as input has only one column. What error message will be generated?
Write you answer here: "Line 0 not XY format in file  "

4.Our program split lines of input files (except the first file) into elements that are tab delimitated. 
However, data could be split by , or many other characters. In this case is a good idea to define a new variable that takes 
the delimiter provide by the user. Using what you learn about sys.argv in this class`. Write a variable that reads a 
delimiter (e.g ‘,’) provided as the first input file.
Write your code here:  delim=sys.argv[3]
ElementList = Line.split('\delim')
